Review Exercise 1 about 40 mins (then show-and-tell)
This is a chance to work with TypeScript/ECMAScript in a mini project.

Tackle this however you like, the point is for you to explore using the tools.

You will load up some data into a type-safe structure, then (optionally) sort the data and show slices of it.

You could manually transpile your .ts to js with tsc, or run directly with tsx.

You could make programatic choices (run in node) or ask the user in a web page (in a browser).

The JSON data is in the gist here: (copy a fragment of this data)

https://gist.github.com/doingandlearning/40ceb809aebc0c22f932b93a9644ca4e

Details
In a new folder, create a .ts file for your code (or make a copy of the init directory and use that)

Get a copy of (some of) the 'todos' array and make sure it is scoped to your code

Write an interface to match the types of a 'todo' member

Use your interface to make the 'todos' array type-safe

Create some type-safe instances which are derived from individual 'todo' members

let todo1:Todo = ...
NB you may need to make use of a tsconfig.json file

Optional
Next you will use the built-in JavaScript array 'sort' and 'filter' methods

Choose a data field to sort the entire 'todos' data set (e.g. by 'userId' or 'completed')

Decide on a strategy to show todos for one user, then just the un-completed jobs for a user

Consider how you could enforce the 'completed' state to be one of:

true, false, archived, pending, deleted

Bit of an open question - Is there an expectation (both in the web dev community and specifically at the BBC), that libraries written in typescript should be easy to consume from vanilla javascript?

It seems that from an API point of view, leaning on the type system could simplify things, but might make use from javascript a bit more fiddly. e.g. you might be more tempted to return multiple types from a function when you have a compiler checking you discriminate at the call site. Similarly you might be more tempted to use function overloads with type checking machinery in place, vs having a bunch of similar functions with names that imply their signature where correct use depends on the user.
